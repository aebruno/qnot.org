<p><em>What do you do for recreation?</em> Oh, the usual. I bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback.</p>

<p style="margin-top:20px;">
While my recreational activities aren't nearly as exciting, I enjoy spending my
time tinkering with code, administering high performance GNU/Linux systems, and
learning how to hack the human genome. I currently work at the <a href="http://www.ccr.buffalo.edu">Center for
Computational Research</a> (CCR) at the <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu">Univeristy at Buffalo</a> where I work as a
software/systems engineer. I like to do many things and tend to keep my plate
extremely full.
</p>

<h3>Software Engineer</h3>
<p>
As a software engineer at CCR, I help support various research groups utilizing
<a href="http://www.ccr.buffalo.edu/display/WEB/Computers+and+platforms">CCR's
infrastructure</a>. The research groups come from all disciplines and many of
the projects involve writing software to process and analyze vast amounts of
scientific data.  Typically we build large data warehouses and create
applications to allow researchers to do searching, reporting, and updating. I
also provide computational support for UB's <a
href="http://nextgenlab.cbi.buffalo.edu/">Next-Generation Sequencing and
Expression Analysis Core</a>, which houses an <a href="http://www.illumina.com/systems/hiseq_2000.ilmn">Illumina HiSeq 2000</a>. 
</p>

<p> Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer for <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly Media</a> developing web applications
and data visualization tools. I spent a considerable amount of time working
with XML technologies and hacking on O'Reilly's corpus of digital content.</p>

<p>A while back I contributed code to <a href="http://developer.marklogic.com/">Mark
Logic's developer network</a> and wrote <a
href="http://developer.marklogic.com/code/cqsh">cqsh</a>, an XQuery
command line shell and <a href="http://developer.marklogic.com/code/libmlxcc">mlxcc</a>, a C API
enabling access to Mark Logic from Perl, Ruby, PHP, and Python. I was invited
to speak at the 2nd (2005) and 3rd (2006) annual <a
href="http://marklogicworld.com/">Mark Logic User conferences</a> (before in was Mark Logic World)
in which I co-presented cqsh, mlxcc, and projects from <a
href="http://labs.oreilly.com">O'Reilly Labs</a>.  </p>

<p>A long time ago I contributed some perl code to <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/wordhks/">Word Hacks</a>, despite my
loathing for all software originating from Redmond.</p>


<p>
You can also find some of my projects on <a href="https://github.com/aebruno">GitHub</a>.

<h3>System Adminstrator</h3>
<p>As a system administrator at CCR, I write code to automate software installations across thousands of linux
compute nodes using <a href="http://cobbler.github.com/">cobbler</a> and <a
href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a>. I administer user account management
systems using Kerberos and LDAP and maintain core network services such as DNS,
DHCP, and NTP. I also build system monitoring <a
href="http://ubmod.sourceforge.net/">tools</a> for tracking resource
utilization and <a href="http://nyserda.ccr.buffalo.edu/">energy consumption</a> on high perfomance compute systems. In addition, I adminster web application
environments running Apache, Tomcat, and MySQL, and virtual machine infrastructure
using <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org">KVM</a> and <a href="http://libvirt.org/">libvirt</a>.</p>

<h3>Web Developer</h3> 
<p>I'm a full stack web developer, i.e., give me <a
href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> and a linux box and I'll cook you up a full
blown web application faster that you can finish a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggy_Pig_and_Silly_Seal#In_other_media">ziggy
piggy.</a></p>
<p>I lead the development of <a href="http://ubmod.sf.net">UBMoD</a>,
an open source data warehouse and web portal for mining statistical data from
resource managers such as <a href="http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/torque.php">TORQUE</a>. </p>
<p>I built the web infrastructure for <a href="#">miRdSNP</a>, a <a href="http://mirdsnp.ccr.buffalo.edu/">database</a>  exploring
disease-associated SNPs and microRNA target sites on 3' untranslated regions of human genes.</p>
<p> While working at <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly Media</a>, I created the web front end
for the O'Reilly Research Portal, a system for <a
href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2006/04/state-of-the-computer-book-mar-1.html">visualizing
book sales and technology trends</a> using <a
href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2008/02/state-of-the-computer-book-mar-20.html">Treemaps</a>
and spearheaded the development of a content repository for remixing
O'Reilly's digital content using <a href="http://www.marklogic.com">Mark
Logic</a> and the <a
href="http://ietfreport.isoc.org/idref/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol/">Atom
Publishing Protocol</a>. 

</p>

<p>In my spare time, I administer an ecommerce site for the Vermont based
outdoor retailer <a href="http://www.klmountainshop.com">KLmountainshop</a>,
which sees on average ~45K unique visitors and ~200K page views per month. In
2010, KLmountainshop grew their online presence 67% making 
<a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/second500/profiles/KLMountainShopcom/#KLMountainShopcom">Internet Retailers Second
500 list</a>.</p>

<h3>Bioinformatician in Training</h3> 
<p> I'm currently a <a
href="http://sphhp.buffalo.edu/biostat/students/bruno_andrew.php">student</a>
in the <a href="http://sphhp.buffalo.edu/biostat/">Department of
Biostatistics</a> at the University at Buffalo and <a
href="http://www.roswellpark.edu/">Roswell Park Cancer Institue</a>. I'm
pursing a Masters in <a
href="http://www.roswellpark.edu/education/masters-programs/bioinformatics-and-biometry">Bioinformatics
and Biometry</a> under the guidence of <a
href="http://www.roswellpark.edu/song-liu">Dr. Song Liu</a>. Currently my
research is focusing on algorithms for detecting fusion genes from
next-generation sequencing data.  </p>
<p>I recently worked on a project which explored the need for biostatisticians
to perform correlation analysis on data from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_comparative_genomic_hybridization">array comparative genome hybridization</a> (aCGH). The <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HIPC.2009.5433190">paper</a> focused on the data-intensive computational
problem of processing large correlation matrices on the order of 1 million rows
by 1 million columns. I implemented an approach using <a
href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> which scaled to 128 compute nodes and
queried the top 200 values in under 40 minutes.  </p>

<h3>Life Goal</h3> 
<p>
Back when diapers weren't at the top of my
weekly shopping list, I used to drive a <a
href="http://left.subtree.org/2007/03/29/farewell-to-an-old-friend/">1972 VW
Westfalia camper bus named stella</a>. One of my life long goals is to pursaude
my wife that it would be in our best interest to own another VW bus.
Specifically, a 21-window <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(bus)">Samba</a>. This is one of
those decision problems that fall under the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete">NP-complete</a> category but I
reamin hopeful.
