<p style="margin-top:20px;">
While my recreational activities aren't nearly as exciting, I enjoy spending my
time tinkering with code, administering high performance GNU/Linux systems, and
learning how to hack the human genome. I currently work at the <a
href="http://ccr.buffalo.edu">Center for Computational Research</a> (CCR)
at the <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu">University at Buffalo</a> where I split
my time between programming and system administration. I like to do many things
and tend to keep my plate extremely full.
</p>

<h3>Software Engineer</h3>
<p>
As a software engineer at CCR I help support research groups from a wide
variety of disciplines utilizing CCR's
high-performance computing <a href="http://ccr.buffalo.edu/support/research_facilities.html">infrastructure</a>. Many of the projects I support involve writing software to
process and analyze large amounts of data. I also provide computational support for UB's <a
href="http://nextgenlab.cbi.buffalo.edu/">Next-Generation Sequencing and
Expression Analysis Core</a>, which houses an <a
href="http://www.illumina.com/systems/hiseq_2000.ilmn">Illumina HiSeq 2000</a>. 
</p>

<p> Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer for <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly Media</a> developing web applications
and data visualization tools. I spent a considerable amount of time 
hacking on O'Reilly's corpus of digital content using XQuery, XSLT, and <a href="http://docbook.org/">DocBook</a>.</p>

<p>A while back I contributed code to <a href="http://developer.marklogic.com/">Mark
Logic's developer network</a> and wrote <a
href="http://developer.marklogic.com/code/cqsh">cqsh</a> an XQuery
command line shell and <a href="http://developer.marklogic.com/code/libmlxcc">mlxcc</a> a C API
enabling access to Mark Logic from Perl, Ruby, PHP, and Python. I was invited
to speak at the 2nd (2005) and 3rd (2006) annual <a
href="http://marklogicworld.com/">Mark Logic User conferences</a> (before it was Mark Logic World)
in which I co-presented cqsh, mlxcc, and projects from <a
href="http://labs.oreilly.com">O'Reilly Labs</a>.  </p>

<p>A long time ago I contributed some Perl code to <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/wordhks/">Word Hacks</a>, despite my
loathing for all software originating from Redmond.</p>

<h3>System Administrator</h3>
<p>As a system administrator at CCR, I write code to automate software installations across thousands of Linux
compute nodes using <a href="http://cobbler.github.com/">cobbler</a> and <a
href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a>. I administer user account management
systems using Kerberos and LDAP and maintain core network services such as DNS,
DHCP, and NTP.</p>
<p>I build system monitoring <a
href="http://ubmod.sourceforge.net/">tools</a> for tracking resource
utilization and <a href="http://nyserda.ccr.buffalo.edu/">energy consumption</a> on high performance compute systems. In addition, I administer web application
environments running Apache, Tomcat, and MySQL, and virtual machine infrastructures
using <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org">KVM</a> and <a href="http://libvirt.org/">libvirt</a>.</p>

<h3>Web Developer</h3> 
<p>
I'm a full stack web developer, i.e., give me <a
href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and a Linux box and I'll cook up a full
blown web application faster that you can finish a <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsBrd3u1JZw">ziggy pig</a>.
</p> 

<p>
I lead the development of <a href="http://ubmod.sf.net">UBMoD</a>, an open
source data warehouse and web portal for mining resource utilization from <a
href="http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/torque.php">TORQUE</a>.
</p>

<p>
I built the web infrastructure for <a
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-13-44">miRdSNP</a>, a <a
href="http://mirdsnp.ccr.buffalo.edu/">database</a>  exploring
disease-associated SNPs and microRNA target sites on 3' untranslated regions of
human genes.
</p>

<p>
While working at <a href="http://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly Media</a>, I created
a web front end and visualization tools using <a
href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2008/02/state-of-the-computer-book-mar-20.html">Treemaps</a>
for O'Reilly's <a
href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/database-war-stories-6-oreilly.html">research
data mart</a>, which includes data on <a
href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/04/state-of-the-computer-book-mar.html">
book sales and technology trends</a>. I also was a lead developer for SafariU,
a print-on-demand publishing platform that enabled college professors to
assemble custom text books using O'Reilly's book chapters and article content. 
</p>

<h3>Bioinformatician in Training</h3> 
<p> In February of 2013, I completed my masters degree in <a
href="http://www.roswellpark.edu/education/masters-programs/bioinformatics-and-biostatistics">Bioinformatics
and Biostatistics</a> from the University at Buffalo and <a
href="http://www.roswellpark.edu/">Roswell Park Cancer Institute</a>. My
research focused on algorithms for detecting fusion genes from
next-generation sequencing data. Part of my masters thesis was devoted to building a tool called <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-14-13">FUSIM</a>, which allows for the complex simulation of fusion transcripts and can be used in testing fusion discovery methods.</p>
<p>A while back I had the opportunity to work on a project which explored the need for biostatisticians
to perform correlation analysis on data from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_comparative_genomic_hybridization">array comparative genome hybridization</a> (aCGH). The <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HIPC.2009.5433190">paper</a> focused on the data-intensive computational
problem of processing large correlation matrices on the order of 1 million rows
by 1 million columns. I implemented an approach using <a
href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> which scaled to 128 compute nodes and
queried the top 200 values in under 40 minutes.  </p>

<h3>Long Term Goal</h3> 
<p>
Back when diapers weren't at the top of my
weekly shopping list, I used to drive a <a
href="http://left.subtree.org/2007/03/29/farewell-to-an-old-friend/">1972 VW
Westfalia camper bus named stella</a>. One of my long term goals is to convince
my wife that it would be in our best interest to own another VW bus.
Specifically, a 21-window <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(bus)">Samba</a>. I fear this may be one of
those decision problems falling under the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete">NP-complete</a> category but I
remain hopeful.
