**Open. Mobile. Free.** That was the tag line printed on the side of the box
which housed my shiny new [Neo
FreeRunner](http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/FreeRunner_Overview). I finally had
some time to sit down and play with this new device and so far it's blown me
away. If you're a Linux geek and haven't checked this out yet I highly
recommend [getting one](http://www.openmoko.com/product.html). It's a truly
open platform with a thriving community and is supported by a company which has
basically open sourced their internal development. Where else could you get the
complete [CAD files](http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/CAD_models) for your phone?
There's a good post about why you might [think twice before buying an
iPhone](http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/5-reasons-to-avoid-iphone-3g) and
picking up a FreeRunner instead.<!--more-->

Here's a few pics of what the Neo looks like all boxed up..

The Neo came bundled with a USB cable, a nifty stylus + laser pen, AC adapter,
battery, and a 512mb microSD card.

The [hardware
specs](http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Neo_FreeRunner_GTA02_Hardware) for the Neo
(GTA02) are impressive, GSM, WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS. All that packed into a full
blown Linux distro that fits in the palm of your hand.

I'll be posting more about my experiences using the Neo as my daily phone. More
to come..
