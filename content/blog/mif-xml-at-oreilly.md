[Keith](http://kfahlgren.com/blog/), a fellow
[O'Reillyer](http://www.oreilly.com), has written a few
[posts](http://kfahlgren.com/blog/?p=34) on how O'Reilly has been making use of
MIF XML (MX). Keith gives some background and example uses as a follow up to my
previous posts on [converting MIF to
XML]({{< ref "blog/converting-mif-to-xml.md" >}}). He also posted
some [XSLT](http://kfahlgren.com/blog/?p=35) for round-tripping the XML back
into MIF.
