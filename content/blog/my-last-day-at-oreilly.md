I recently finished up my last day as an [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com)
employee. I decided it was time to take the next step in my career and have
accepted a position at the [Center for Computational
Research](http://ccr.buffalo.edu/). My last day at O'Reilly was an
emotional one and it was sad saying goodbye to the wonderful relationships I
had built throughout my time there. I had the opportunity to work with some
amazing people and wish them all well in the future.
