Eight windmills now line up the shore of Lake Erie at the site which was once
home to the old [Bethlehem Steel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem_Steel)
plant. It's exciting to see Buffalo on the forefront of renewable energy and
this new wind farm dubbed "Steel Winds" is the first urban wind farm in the
country.  It's also the world's first commercial project to use Clipper
Windpower's [Liberty series
turbines](http://www.clipperwind.com/techspecs.php).<!--more-->

Here's some quick stats about the turbines:

- Stand approximately 255 feet tall (410 feet with blades extended)
- Can potentially produce 20 megawatts of pollution-free electric power
- Could provide the annual electrical needs of more than 6,000 homes
- Total project cost around $40 million

There's also talk about expanding the project to include as many as 19
additional windmills.
