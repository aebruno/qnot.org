Well it's been just over 2 years now since I picked up my [Neo
Freerunner](http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Neo_FreeRunner) and unfortunately I
have nothing good to report back. When I first got my hands on the Freerunner I
had great expectations as can be seen in my
[previous]({{< ref "neo-freerunner-freedom.md" >}})
[posts]({{< ref "freerunner-first-boot.md" >}}) however it
turns out I was little too optimistic. <!--more-->

My hope was to write about my experience developing applications for the device
but it seems as though I was one of the unlucky users who suffered from the
infamous [buzz](http://markmail.org/thread/vpq2onob27fsz4bc). And I don't mean
buzz in a good way :) Apparently this didn't effect every user and was more
prevalent when using certain GSM bands. However random it may have been for
some users it was an absolute show stopper for me and rendered the device
pretty much unusable as a phone. Anytime I placed a call, the person on the
other end heard a horrible loud buzzing sound. After a while Openmoko finally
tracked down the [source of the
buzzing](http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/hardware/2008-August/000415.html)
to a hardware problem and [published some
instructions](http://people.openmoko.org/joerg/GSM_EMI_noise/) on how to mod
the device (known as the [big-C
rework](http://people.openmoko.org/joerg/GSM_EMI_noise/big-C_rework_SOP_rc2.pdf)).
Unfortunately it requires some fairly advanced SMD-soldering skills and is way
out of my league. As far as I know, Openmoko never really offered much help in
resolving the issue for people who had already purchased the device with the
hardware flaw (rev A5/A6) and were unable to preform the necessary surgery. 

Despite the lacking phone functionality the Freerunner itself is still pretty
cool.  I'm sure I'll be able to think of some other fun projects to use it for
especially since it [runs Debian](http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Debian).
