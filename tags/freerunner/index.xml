      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s some notes on my initial experience setting up the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/FreeRunner_Overview&#34;&gt;Neo
Freerunner&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve been
meaning to write this post for a while now and most of this is already old
stuff but I&#39;m posting it anyhow for reference. I purchased the Neo Freerunner
fully aware that it was a developer phone but my hope was that I could at least
ssh into the device and make/receive a few phone calls. I&#39;m happy to report
that after first booting I was able to get most things functioning within a few
hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Neo FreeRunner = Freedom</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open. Mobile. Free.&lt;/strong&gt; That was the tag line printed on the side of the box
which housed my shiny new &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/FreeRunner_Overview&#34;&gt;Neo
FreeRunner&lt;/a&gt;. I finally had
some time to sit down and play with this new device and so far it&#39;s blown me
away. If you&#39;re a Linux geek and haven&#39;t checked this out yet I highly
recommend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openmoko.com/product.html&#34;&gt;getting one&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a truly
open platform with a thriving community and is supported by a company which has
basically open sourced their internal development. Where else could you get the
complete &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/CAD_models&#34;&gt;CAD files&lt;/a&gt; for your phone?
There&#39;s a good post about why you might &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/5-reasons-to-avoid-iphone-3g&#34;&gt;think twice before buying an
iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and
picking up a FreeRunner instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
